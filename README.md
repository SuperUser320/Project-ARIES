#Project ARIES
###Background
Project ARIES was originally designed with the intent of creating a scale car capable of autonomously and intelligently identify obstacles approaching on its course and stop or alter course before a collision occurs.  I started this project as a side project the summer before my Senior year of high school and continued it throughout the year as an independent study project.
